-- you can return only one tag from function in react


<> :- fragments
   :- return empty container



Using Vite :- file extension only must be .jsx
           :- function name start with capital letter
           :- script tag write into index.html

Using create-react  :- file extension .js or .jsx
                    :- function name must start with capital letter
                    :- script tag automatic write during execution
                    


--> <h1> this is H1 tag and my name is {username} </h1>

here, {username} is called evaluted expression which means it prints only final result value also, it's not execute JS expression 




// Hooks  :- useState, useEffect 

# useState  :- define state which is updated
            :- it return array of two value one is statevalue and second is setstatevalue

ex,   let [count, setCount] = useState(15)
here, count is statevalue & setCount is a method(function) use to update value also useState(0) is a state with inital value is 0




// Browser DOM    :- create a new structure of DOM if any changes do
// Virtual DOM    :- doesn't create whole structure of DOM, it change the branch which is updated




// What is reconciliation?
--> The algorithm react uses to diffrenciate one tree(Browser tree) with another (React virtual tree) to determine which parts need to be changed.
--> reconciliation is called as Virtual DOM




# Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.

# Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

# The reconciler does the work of computing which parts of a tree have changed; the renderer then uses that information to actually update the rendered app.



#The key points are:

1) In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.

2) Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.

3)A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.



// What is react Fiber?
--> the goal of react fiber is,

   1) pause work and come back to it later.
   2) assign priority to different types of work.
   3) reuse previously completed work.
   4) abort work if it's no longer needed.



# props :- make component reuseable

# onClick method require only function
